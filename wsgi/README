I got most of these instructions from

http://www.jeremybowers.com/blog/post/5/django-nginx-and-uwsgi-production-serving-millions-page-views/

1) Download the latest stable nginx tarball, compile it (with no special
options).  The relevant files for it will live in /usr/local/nginx/...
2) Download the latest uWsgi tarball, compile it (using the Makefile for
your version of python), and copy the compiled binary to /usr/sbin/uwsgi
3) Follow the instructions for Upstart (on Ubuntu) installs for nginx and a
confo instance of uwsgi from the two files in the upstart directory.
Essentially, copy the two .conf files in the upstart/ directory to
/etc/init, reload upstart's configuration, and start both services.
4) Copy the nginx.conf from nginx to the nginx configuration directory (see
nginx.conf in the nginx/ directory), and restart nginx with upstart.
5) Profit
